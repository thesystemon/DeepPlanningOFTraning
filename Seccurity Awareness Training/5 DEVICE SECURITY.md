### **Slide 1 ‚Äî ‚ÄúYour Device = Your Gateway to the Company‚Äù**

> ‚ÄúIf your device is compromised, your company is compromised.‚Äù

Every laptop, phone, or tablet is a **doorway to company data** ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre just checking email or Slack.
Hackers don‚Äôt need to hack the server if they can infect your device first.

---

### **Slide 2 ‚Äî Common Device Security Risks**

| Threat                    | Description                      | Example                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Theft / Loss**          | Unattended devices can be stolen | Laptop left in taxi or caf√©                |
| **Malware / Keyloggers**  | From untrusted downloads or USBs | Free ‚Äúvideo converter‚Äù tool infects device |
| **Unpatched Systems**     | Old software vulnerabilities     | Windows not updated ‚Üí ransomware entry     |
| **Unsafe Wi-Fi**          | Public Wi-Fi interception        | Attacker sniffs traffic at coffee shop     |

### **Slide 4 ‚Äî Mobile Device Security**

Your phone holds sensitive data ‚Äî emails, chats, files, MFA apps.
It needs the same level of protection as your laptop.

**Best Practices:**
üì± Enable **strong PIN, fingerprint, or face unlock**
üì± **Install apps only from official stores** (Google Play / App Store)
üì± **Disable Bluetooth & Wi-Fi** when not in use
üì± **Turn off auto-connect** to public Wi-Fi networks
üì± **Avoid jailbreaking / rooting** devices
üì± **Use MDM (Mobile Device Management)** if provided by company
üì± **Enable remote wipe** (Find My Device / Find My iPhone)

üß© *Visual Activity:*
Show 5 pictures ‚Äî identify poor device security habits (e.g., unlocked PC, USB left in port).

---

### **Slide 8 ‚Äî What To Do If Device is Lost / Stolen**

1. Report to IT/Security team (email, call hotline).
2. If possible, trigger **remote wipe** or **lock**.
3. Change passwords linked to that device (email, VPN, apps).
4. File police report (for audit and legal proof).

**Don‚Äôt try to recover it alone.**
**Never delay reporting** ‚Äî time matters.

---

### **Slide 9 ‚Äî Organizational Security Controls**

* Enforced BitLocker/FileVault encryption
* Automatic screen lock after 5 minutes idle
* USB port control policies
* Mobile Device Management (MDM) for smartphones
* Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
* Zero Trust access control for remote workers

---

### **Slide 10 ‚Äî Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ Treat every device as a **company asset**.
‚úÖ Lock, encrypt, and back up.
‚úÖ Avoid plugging unknown devices.
