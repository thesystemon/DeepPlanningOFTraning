## 📚 **Slide / PDF Content — In Depth**

---

### **Slide 1 — “Data is the New Oil… And It Must Be Protected”**

> “Every click, every form, every email may contain data — and once leaked, it can’t be taken back.”

Explain why data is valuable:

* Personal info can be sold, misused, or used for identity theft.
* Company data (clients, finances, credentials) = target for cybercriminals.
* Privacy is not optional — it’s a **legal requirement**.

🧩 *Trainer Tip:*
Start with a real case — e.g., an HR employee accidentally emailed a salary sheet to the wrong department → internal data breach.

---

### **Slide 2 — What is Data Privacy?**

**Data Privacy** = Protecting how data is collected, used, stored, and shared.
**Data Protection** = Technical + procedural safeguards that enforce privacy.

📦 Example:

* Privacy → Deciding **who can access** your data.
* Protection → Implementing **encryption and access control** to enforce that decision.

---

### **Slide 3 — Types of Data**

| Data Type                              | Description              | Examples                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Public Data**                        | Can be shared openly     | Company blog, ads              |
| **Internal Data**                      | For internal use only    | Staff contact list             |
| **Confidential Data**                  | Restricted access        | Financials, project docs       |
| **PII (Personally Identifiable Info)** | Identifies an individual | Name, DOB, ID, email           |
| **Sensitive Personal Data**            | Needs extra protection   | Health, biometric, salary info |

🧩 *Trainer Demo:*
Show a short exercise — classify data items like “Employee ID card”, “Invoice”, “CCTV Footage” → audience labels them.

---

### **Slide 4 — Data Classification & Labeling**

Organizations classify data into levels (Public / Internal / Confidential / Restricted).
**Why?** So employees know **how to handle** each type.

✅ **Label examples:**

* “Confidential – Internal Use Only”
* “Restricted – HR Department Only”
* “Public – Safe to Share”

🧩 *Activity:*
Show a screenshot of a document → ask participants to choose correct label.

---

### **Slide 5 — Secure Data Handling Lifecycle**

**1️⃣ Collection:**

* Collect only what’s necessary (“Data Minimization”).
* Get consent before gathering personal info.

**2️⃣ Storage:**

* Store only in approved systems (CRM, ERP, or secured cloud).
* Encrypt files at rest (BitLocker, VeraCrypt, OneDrive encryption).

**3️⃣ Access & Use:**

* Grant access based on **need-to-know**.
* Avoid downloading sensitive files to personal devices.

**4️⃣ Sharing & Transmission:**

* Use encrypted emails or company-approved file sharing.
* Never use personal Gmail/WhatsApp for official data.

**5️⃣ Retention & Disposal:**

* Follow company retention policy (e.g., delete after 3 years).
* Shred physical copies and use secure delete tools (Eraser, BleachBit).

---

### **Slide 6 — Unsafe Data Practices (Real-World Examples)**

⚠️ Sending client data over personal email
⚠️ Uploading customer info to Google Sheets or Notion
⚠️ Sharing internal spreadsheets on Slack or WhatsApp
⚠️ Leaving printed documents on desks
⚠️ Copying files to personal USBs
⚠️ Not logging out from shared systems

🧩 *Trainer Demo:*
Show “email to wrong recipient” simulation → what happens when confidential data is leaked accidentally.

---

### **Slide 7 — Email & File Sharing Security**

* Always double-check recipient before sending attachments.
* Use **“Encrypt Email”** or **password-protected ZIPs** for sensitive files.
* Use company-approved tools:

  * Microsoft 365 SharePoint
  * Google Workspace Drive
  * Nextcloud (open-source option)

✅ Never use **WeTransfer, Dropbox (personal), or Telegram** for company data.

### **Slide 8 — Data Privacy Laws (Simplified)**

| Regulation                | Applies To                     | Core Principle                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **GDPR (EU)**             | EU citizens’ data              | Consent, Right to be Forgotten  |
| **ISO 27001**             | Information Security Framework | Risk-based control              |
| **India DPDP Act (2023)** | Indian personal data           | User consent, data minimization |
| **HIPAA (US)**            | Health data                    | Privacy + Security Rule         |
| **PCI-DSS**               | Card payments                  | Encryption, restricted access   |

🧩 *Trainer Tip:*
You don’t need to teach law — just awareness: “If we mishandle data, we break compliance.”

### **Slide 9 — Secure Physical Handling**

📄 Lock file cabinets
🗑 Use shredders for printed confidential data
🖨 Collect prints immediately from shared printers
🪪 Never share access cards
📷 Don’t take photos of screens or documents

---

### **Slide 10 — Data Breach Response**

If you accidentally send or leak data:

1️⃣ **Don’t delete or hide it.**
2️⃣ **Report immediately** to your IT/Security/Privacy Officer.
3️⃣ **Provide details:** What data, who received, when.
4️⃣ **Contain:** Revoke access, recall email, change permissions.
5️⃣ **Follow company breach procedure.**

Early reporting can prevent escalation and fines.
