## üìö Slide / PDF Content ‚Äî In Depth

### **Slide 1 ‚Äî ‚ÄúAdmins Hold the Keys to the Kingdom‚Äù**

> ‚ÄúWith great power comes great responsibility ‚Äî especially when your login can control every system.‚Äù

IT and System Admins have **super-user privileges** ‚Äî making them **prime targets for attackers** and potential sources of internal mistakes.

üí° **Key Risks:**

* Privileged credential compromise
* Misconfigured systems (default passwords, open ports)
* Missed patches / unpatched software
* Insider misuse or accidental escalation
* Unsecured remote access (RDP, SSH)

üß© **Case Example:**
A ransomware attack on a logistics company began when an IT admin reused a password across multiple servers ‚Äî one credential leak led to complete domain compromise.

### **Slide 2 ‚Äî Core Responsibilities of IT & SysAdmins**

| Area                  | Objective                       | Risk if Ignored                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Access Control**    | Limit rights to what users need | Privilege abuse, insider threat |
| **Patch Management**  | Keep OS, apps, firmware updated | Exploited vulnerabilities       |
| **System Hardening**  | Disable unnecessary services    | Backdoors & lateral movement    |
| **Monitoring & Logs** | Detect abnormal activities      | Missed breach indicators        |
| **Backup & Recovery** | Ensure data availability        | Ransomware loss                 |
| **Incident Response** | Quick containment of attacks    | Longer downtime                 |

üß© **Trainer Demo:** Show an example of a misconfigured RDP port visible on Shodan ‚Üí discuss impact.

### **Slide 3 ‚Äî Access Control Best Practices (Zero Trust Model)**

| Practice                               | Description                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Least Privilege**                    | Give users the *minimum* rights they need.                |
| **Role-Based Access (RBAC)**           | Group permissions by job function (Admin, User, Auditor). |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  | Required for all admin-level logins.                      |
| **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** | Use tools to control privileged credentials.              |
| **Account Review**                     | Disable unused or old admin accounts monthly.             |
| **Logging & Audit Trails**             | Track every admin action for accountability.              |

üß© **Example:**

* Create separate accounts: `john_admin` for elevated tasks, `john_user` for normal work.
* Never use domain admin for daily tasks.

### **Slide 4 ‚Äî Patching & Vulnerability Management**

> ‚ÄúUnpatched systems are open doors waiting to be used.‚Äù

| Step                       | Description                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory Systems**  | Know every device, OS, app in your environment.        |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor CVEs**       | Subscribe to NVD or vendor security bulletins.         |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritize by Risk** | Critical vulnerabilities first (CVSS ‚â• 8).             |
| **4Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Patching**  | Use WSUS, SCCM, or Ansible for updates.                |
| **5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify & Report**    | Log patch success, validate via vulnerability scanner. |

üß© **Trainer Tip:** Show a live example of an outdated software ‚Üí demonstrate patch application & CVE closure.

### **Slide 5 ‚Äî Privilege Misuse & Insider Risk Prevention**

| Risk                        | Example                             | Defense                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Overprivileged Accounts** | Developers with domain admin rights | Role-based access control    |
| **Shared Admin Passwords**  | One password for all admins         | Use PAM or password vault    |
| **Command Abuse**           | Admin installs unauthorized tools   | Monitoring + approval policy |
| **Log Tampering**           | Admin clears logs after changes     | Centralized logging (SIEM)   |
| **Shadow IT**               | Use of unapproved SaaS tools        | Whitelisting policy          |

üß© Real Case: Admin used PowerShell to extract HR data ‚Äî unnoticed for 3 months due to missing audit logs.

### **Slide 6 ‚Äî Remote Access & Endpoint Security**

| Area                     | Secure Practice                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **RDP Access**           | Use VPN + MFA, disable if not required |
| **SSH / Telnet**         | Allow SSH only with key-based auth     |
| **Admin Workstations**   | Separate from regular desktops         |
| **Portable Devices**     | Encrypt drives with BitLocker / LUKS   |
| **USB Devices**          | Restrict or log all device connections |

üß© Tip: Avoid using admin credentials on user systems ‚Äî use temporary elevation tools instead.

---

### **Slide 7 ‚Äî Patch Policy & Vulnerability Scanner Setup**

‚úî Monthly patch window (e.g., second Saturday)
‚úî Maintain patch log & report exceptions
‚úî Use tools like:

* **Qualys / OpenVAS / Nessus** for vulnerability scans
* **WSUS / Ansible / Intune** for automated patch rollout
  ‚úî Conduct quarterly system hardening audit

üß© Activity: Scan a sample endpoint with OpenVAS and analyze vulnerabilities.

---

### **Slide 8 ‚Äî Incident Response for Admins**

If you suspect compromise:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Disconnect system** from network immediately.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Inform Security / SOC team** ‚Äî don‚Äôt fix silently.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Preserve logs** for forensics.
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Change passwords** post-incident.
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Document everything** for audit and RCA.

üß© Tip: Never hide admin errors ‚Äî early reporting prevents escalation.

### **Slide 9 ‚Äî Admin Security Checklist**

# | Task | Status

--|------|--------
1 | Maintain inventory of all admin accounts | ‚òê
2 | Enforce MFA for privileged access | ‚òê
3 | Patch OS and software monthly | ‚òê
4 | Disable unused services and ports | ‚òê
5 | Use PAM or vault for credentials | ‚òê
6 | Log and audit all admin actions | ‚òê
7 | Segregate admin network from user LAN | ‚òê
8 | Regular vulnerability scans | ‚òê
9 | Test backups quarterly | ‚òê
10 | Remove access of ex-employees | ‚òê

### **Slide 10 ‚Äî Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ Privileged accounts = biggest security risk if unmanaged.
‚úÖ Follow *least privilege*, *MFA*, and *logging* as your golden trio.
‚úÖ Patch consistently, automate when possible.
‚úÖ Always separate duties: no single admin should have total control.
‚úÖ Report issues early, document everything for audit readiness.

> ‚ÄúThe best admins aren‚Äôt the ones who fix everything ‚Äî they‚Äôre the ones who prevent the need to.‚Äù üîê
