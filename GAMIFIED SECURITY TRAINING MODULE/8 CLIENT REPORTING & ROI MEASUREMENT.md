## 📚 Slide-by-Slide Deep Content

### **Slide 1 — Why ROI Measurement Matters**

> “What gets measured, gets improved — and what gets improved, earns trust.”

**Purpose:**
ROI measurement is not just about showing numbers — it’s about proving *behavioral change, engagement, and security risk reduction.*

**Why it matters:**

* Builds client trust and renewal opportunities.
* Justifies training investment to leadership.
* Highlights measurable change in employee behavior.
* Enables data-driven decision-making for future awareness programs.

💡 **Trainer Tip:** Begin with a story — show before/after stats from a past campaign:
*“Click rate dropped from 18% to 3% in 90 days — that’s ROI you can see.”*

### **Slide 2 — 4 Dimensions of Measurement**

| Dimension                  | Focus                      | Metrics                                 | Tools                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1️⃣ **Engagement**         | Participation & Completion | Completion %, quiz attempts, login rate | LMS, Power BI           |
| 2️⃣ **Behavioral Change**  | Risk reduction             | Phishing click rate, report rate        | PhishER, GoPhish        |
| 3️⃣ **Learning Retention** | Knowledge improvement      | Pre- vs Post-quiz score                 | LMS Analytics           |
| 4️⃣ **ROI / Impact**       | Value delivered            | Cost savings, breach risk delta         | Power BI / Excel models |

💡 **Trainer Tip:** Use this 4D model on a single dashboard page for visual clarity.

### **Slide 3 — Key Metrics to Track**

| Category                   | Metric                         | Description                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 📈 **Engagement**          | Module Completion Rate         | % of users completing training               |
| 🧠 **Knowledge Retention** | Quiz Accuracy Improvement      | Average increase from pre → post             |
| 🧩 **Behavioral Change**   | Phish Click Rate Reduction     | % drop in failed phishing simulations        |
| 🧰 **Proactive Defense**   | Report Rate                    | % of users who reported simulated phish      |
| 🏆 **Gamification**        | Points Earned / Badges Claimed | Participation & motivation index             |
| 💬 **Satisfaction**        | User Feedback Score            | Training relevance & enjoyment               |
| 💸 **ROI**                 | Cost Avoidance                 | Projected loss reduction from user awareness |

💡 **Trainer Tip:** Always include both *quantitative (data)* and *qualitative (feedback)* metrics in reports.

---

### **Slide 4 — Calculating ROI: The Formula**

**ROI (%) = (Net Benefit − Program Cost) ÷ Program Cost × 100**

**Example:**

* Average cost of a phishing breach = $200,000
* Click rate reduction = 80%
* Estimated risk savings = $160,000
* Program cost = $20,000

📊 **ROI = (160,000 − 20,000) / 20,000 × 100 = 700% ROI**

💡 **Trainer Tip:** Clients love real examples. Present ROI as “Value Delivered” — not just numbers.

---

### **Slide 5 — Power BI / Dashboard Setup Example**

**Dashboard Sections:**
1️⃣ **Overview Tab** → Summary KPIs (Completion, Click Rate, ROI %)
