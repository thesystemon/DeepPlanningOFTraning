### **Slide 1 ‚Äî ‚ÄúFrontline Staff: First Defense Against Cyber Threats‚Äù**

> ‚ÄúYour support team is the first human firewall ‚Äî every call, chat, and ticket is a potential attack vector.‚Äù

Frontline staff have access to sensitive information: customer PII, billing details, support tickets, troubleshooting logs, and sometimes privileged internal knowledge. Attackers exploit this trust using **social engineering**.

üí° **Common Threats:**

* Caller pretending to be a client requesting sensitive info.
* Phishing links sent in support tickets or chats.
* Malicious attachments in customer emails.
* Internal policy bypass attempts (asking for password resets).
* Fake complaint or urgent requests to manipulate staff.

üß© **Trainer Tip:** Share a real incident where a support agent almost gave access to an attacker ‚Äî highlight red flags.
