**Slide 4 — Reporting Steps**
1️⃣ Identify: Recognize suspicious behavior, email, or file.
2️⃣ Escalate: Use official channels — internal ticketing, IT/Security email, hotline.
3️⃣ Document: Note date/time, sender, file name, and any action taken.
4️⃣ Contain: Don’t forward suspicious email; isolate device if needed.
5️⃣ Follow-up: Cooperate with IT/Security team investigation.

💡 Tip: Never try to delete or fix incidents alone — always report first.

---

**Slide 5 — Reinforcement Programs**

* **Simulations & Drills:** Monthly phishing simulations, fake invoice tests, social engineering role-plays.
* **Dashboards & Analytics:** Track reporting rates, phishing click rates, incident response times.
* **Continuous Feedback:** Send weekly micro-tips via email, Slack, or Teams.
* **Gamification:** Leaderboards, recognition, and rewards for proactive reporters.

**Activity:** Run a mini phishing simulation during the session and review results immediately.

---

**Slide 6 — Incident Tracking & Dashboards**

* Metrics to monitor:

  * Number of incidents reported per department
  * Average response time
  * Repeat mistakes or recurring threats
  * Click rates on phishing simulations
* Helps management identify high-risk areas and target training accordingly.

**Trainer Tip:** Show a sample dashboard with colorful charts, KPIs, and trends.

---

**Slide 7 — Continuous Improvement Loop**
1️⃣ **Report** → 2️⃣ **Analyze** → 3️⃣ **Train** → 4️⃣ **Simulate** → 5️⃣ **Repeat**

* Lessons learned from reports improve future training.
* Encourage a culture of proactive awareness.

---

**Slide 8 — Encouraging a Reporting Culture**
