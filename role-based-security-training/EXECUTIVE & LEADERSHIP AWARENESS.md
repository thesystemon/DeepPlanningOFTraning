## üìö Slide / PDF Content ‚Äî In Depth

### **Slide 1 ‚Äî ‚ÄúLeadership Sets the Cyber Tone‚Äù**

> ‚ÄúCybersecurity starts at the top. Culture follows leadership.‚Äù

Executives are prime targets because they have:

* **Access**: Financial, legal, and strategic data.
* **Authority**: Their approvals move funds or unlock data.
* **Influence**: Their behavior defines security culture for everyone else.

üß© **Trainer Tip:** Begin with a real-world breach where a CEO was tricked into authorizing a fraudulent payment (e.g., *‚Ç¨220K BEC scam via deepfake voice in 2023*).

| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** | Impersonation of CEO/CFO to request urgent transfers. | ‚ÄúWire $100K to vendor immediately!‚Äù email.     |

| **Deepfake & AI Voice Fraud**       | Synthetic voice/video to mimic executives.            | Fake CEO call ordering fund transfer.          |
| **Data Theft via Assistants**       | Attackers use exec assistants or PAs as side doors.   | Compromise via shared inbox or USB.            |
| **Social Media Profiling**          | Scanning LinkedIn, X, etc. to target leaders.         | ‚ÄúFake recruitment‚Äù or ‚Äúevent invites‚Äù as bait. |

üß© Demo: Show a fake ‚ÄúCEO payment request‚Äù email and have participants spot red flags.

### **Slide 3 ‚Äî The Business Impact of a Breach**

Cyber incidents are **not IT problems ‚Äî they‚Äôre business risks.**
