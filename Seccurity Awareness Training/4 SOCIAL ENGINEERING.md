# 📘 **Chapter 4 — SOCIAL ENGINEERING (Voice, SMS & Imposter Calls)**

This chapter teaches employees how attackers exploit **human emotions** — trust, fear, urgency — instead of code or systems.

It follows the same **client-ready deep structure** as Chapter 1 (Phishing) and Chapter 2 (Passwords & MFA), so you can use it directly in real client trainings or awareness campaigns.

---

## 🧠 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, participants will:

* Understand what *social engineering* is and how it manipulates human behavior.
* Recognize real-world examples: voice scams (vishing), SMS phishing (smishing), and imposter calls.
* Identify emotional triggers used by attackers.
* Know how to verify identity before sharing any information.
* Learn safe reporting and escalation practices.

## 📚 **Slide / PDF Content — Deep Explanation**

### **Slide 1 — Hook: “The Human Firewall Can Be Hacked”**

> “Hackers don’t always break in — sometimes they just ask politely.”

Attackers exploit people, not just systems.
Even with strong passwords and MFA, one convincing call or SMS can compromise everything.

---

### **Slide 2 — What Is Social Engineering?**

**Definition:**
A manipulation technique where attackers trick people into revealing information, transferring money, or granting access — by pretending to be someone they trust.

**Core idea:**
💬 “It’s easier to hack a person than a firewall.”

### **Slide 3 — Common Social Engineering Channels**

| Type                   | Medium            | Example                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Vishing**            | Voice/Phone       | Fake “bank security” calls      |
| **Smishing**           | SMS/Text          | “Your parcel is on hold” links  |
| **Imposter Calls**     | Any               | Fake IT helpdesk, HR, or boss   |
| **Social Media Lures** | LinkedIn/Facebook | “Job offer” messages with links |

---

### **Slide 4 — The Attacker’s Playbook: Psychological Triggers**

1. **Urgency** — “Your account will be suspended in 10 minutes!”
2. **Authority** — Pretending to be CEO, Police, IT Admin.
3. **Fear** — “Your salary won’t be processed unless you confirm.”
4. **Curiosity** — “You’ve won a gift card!”
5. **Greed** — “Quick investment doubling your money.”
6. **Empathy** — “Help me, I’m stuck and need OTP.”

🧩 *Trainer Demo:*
Play two short recorded calls — one legitimate, one fake — and have the class identify emotional cues.

---

### **Slide 5 — Vishing (Voice Phishing)**

**Tactic:**
Attackers call pretending to be trusted entities (bank, IT support, HR, vendor) and ask for confidential info.

**Common scripts:**

* “We noticed suspicious activity on your account. Please verify your OTP.”
* “I’m from the IT team, I need your login to update the server.”

**Prevention Tips:**
✅ Never share OTPs or passwords over calls.
✅ Hang up and **call back via official numbers** (from company portal or card).
✅ Verify caller identity via internal channels (Teams, Slack, etc.).
✅ Record caller number and report it to IT/SOC.

🧩 *Trainer Role Play:*
One trainer acts as fake IT support; participant practices refusal politely.

---

### **Slide 6 — Smishing (SMS Phishing)**

**Example messages:**

* “Your package delivery failed, click to reschedule.”
* “Your bank account is locked, verify here.”

**Red Flags:**
📍 Unknown sender numbers.
📍 Shortened links (bit.ly, tinyurl).
📍 Misspellings or informal tone.
📍 Urgent instructions.

**Safe Action:**
🚫 Don’t click links.
🚫 Don’t reply with sensitive info.
✅ Report SMS to IT/security mailbox (screenshot + sender ID).
✅ Delete after reporting.

---

### **Slide 7 — Imposter Calls (CEO Fraud / Business Email Compromise Extension)**

**Scenario:**
Employee receives urgent call from “CEO” or “Finance Head” to make quick payment.

**Clues:**

* Caller insists on secrecy.
* Urgent tone, after-hours requests.
* Pressure to bypass approval workflows.

**Prevention:**
✅ Follow multi-level approval policy.
✅ Never process urgent payment without **secondary verification**.
✅ Confirm with real manager through **official channel** before action.

🧩 *Case Study:*
Company lost ₹ 8 lakh after employee followed “CEO’s call.”
Training led to new “call-back verification” rule — prevented later attacks.

---

### **Slide 8 — Real World Case Studies**

**Case 1: Bank Vishing Fraud**
An employee received “bank verification” call — shared card OTP — account drained in minutes.

**Case 2: Fake IT Support Call**
Attacker installed remote software claiming to “remove virus.” Gained access to internal CRM.

**Lesson:**
Technology can’t patch human trust — awareness is key.

---

### **Slide 9 — Reporting Process**

1. If you receive a suspicious call or SMS:

   * Don’t engage. Hang up.
   * Note down caller ID, time, and short description.
   * Report via **official channel**:

     * SOC email: `security@company.com`
     * IT Helpdesk portal
   * Share screenshots or call logs safely.

2. Don’t forward the SMS or number to other employees — it spreads risk.

---

### **Slide 10 — Verification Checklist**

Before sharing any info, ask yourself:

1. Do I know this person?
2. Is the request expected and logical?
3. Is this channel official?
4. Have I verified through another contact?
5. Is there urgency pressure?

If any answer = “No” → **Stop & Report.**

---

### **Slide 11 — Organizational Controls**

* Use **call verification policy** (internal extensions only).
* Display **security banners** for external emails.
* Use **caller ID protection** or **VoIP filters**.
* Train all front-desk & finance teams — primary vishing targets.

---

### **Slide 12 — Hands-On Activities**

**Activity A:**
Listen to 3 recorded calls — mark which are real vs fake and why.

**Activity B:**
SMS Quiz — show 5 sample SMS messages; identify which ones are scams.

**Activity C:**
Role play “CEO fraud” scenario — test team’s verification procedure.
