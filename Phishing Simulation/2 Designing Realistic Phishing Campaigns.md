## 📚 **Slide / PDF Content — In Depth**

### **Slide 1 — Why Realism Matters in Phishing Simulations**

* Employees can easily spot “obvious” phishing emails — training fails if simulations are too easy.
* Realistic campaigns mimic real threats like **invoice scams, HR updates, or credential theft**.
* The goal: improve *decision-making under pressure*, not to embarrass employees.
* The more authentic your campaign, the stronger your human firewall becomes.

💡 **Trainer Tip:** Show examples of *poorly written fake emails vs. realistic corporate-style scams*.

### **Slide 2 — Anatomy of a Realistic Phishing Email**

| Component                | Description                                          | Example                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Sender Name**          | Imitate familiar domains (not spoofing real ones)    | `hr-updates@secure-hrmail.com`              |
| **Subject Line**         | Urgent or curiosity-driven                           | “Action Required: Policy Update Pending”    |
| **Email Body**           | Short, formatted, professional                       | Logo, greeting, simple CTA                  |
| **Call to Action (CTA)** | Clear link or button                                 | “View Policy” → leads to fake training page |
| **Landing Page**         | Imitates real portal but hosted securely for testing | Mock login or info form                     |

⚠️ Always ensure ethical safe domains and consent before launching.

### **Slide 3 — Types of Phishing Simulation Scenarios**

| Type                   | Description                                 | Example                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Credential Theft**   | Fake login page to collect “test” inputs    | “Password expired – update now”            |
| **Invoice Fraud**      | Mimics finance or vendor invoice mail       | “Outstanding payment – verify immediately” |
| **HR Communication**   | Imitates HR policy update or benefits email | “New WFH guidelines released”              |
| **IT/Helpdesk Alerts** | Fake ticket or system alert                 | “Unusual login detected from new device”   |
| **Social Media Phish** | Mimics LinkedIn or Instagram alerts         | “Your profile is being verified”           |

💡 **Trainer Demo:** Show sample campaigns for 2–3 departments (HR, Finance, IT).

### **Slide 4 — Designing Step-by-Step Phishing Campaign**

1️⃣ **Define Objective:**

* Example: Measure who clicks vs. who reports.

2️⃣ **Select Target Group:**

* Based on department, access level, or geography.

3️⃣ **Craft the Message:**

* Relevant subject, tone, and branding style.

4️⃣ **Build the Landing Page:**

* Safe test portal for awareness capture.

5️⃣ **Configure Tracking:**

* Clicks, form entries, reporting rate.

6️⃣ **Send in Batches:**

* Avoid entire company at once — segment rollout.

7️⃣ **Analyze & Report Results:**

* Click %, report %, repeat offenders.

---

### **Slide 5 — Campaign Ethics & Privacy Rules**

✅ Always obtain management consent.
✅ Avoid real credential collection or system integration.
✅ Inform employees *post-simulation* — share learnings, not names.
✅ Keep reports anonymized (focus on team-level improvement).
✅ Use company-approved simulation tools only (e.g., GoPhish, KnowBe4).

💡 **Tip:** Reinforce that *phishing simulations are a learning experience — not a trap.*

### **Slide 6 — Metrics that Matter**

| Metric                  | Purpose                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Click Rate**          | Measures curiosity or carelessness        |
| **Report Rate**         | Indicates awareness and active vigilance  |
| **Data Entry Rate**     | Tracks how many went too far              |
| **Repeat Offenders**    | Identify employees needing extra training |
| **Departmental Trends** | Show which teams are high risk            |

Trainer Tip: Present results visually (pie charts or trend graphs).

---

### **Slide 7 — Post-Simulation Reinforcement**

1️⃣ Conduct debrief sessions within 48 hours.
2️⃣ Share anonymized insights — “10% clicked, 60% reported!”
3️⃣ Praise reporters publicly, guide clickers privately.
4️⃣ Send micro-tips weekly on recognizing similar threats.
5️⃣ Schedule next simulation with new theme.

🎯 **Goal:** Create a cycle of *Test → Learn → Improve → Retest.*

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email Spot-the-Phish Game** | Display 3 emails, ask employees to spot the fake.                          |
| **Build-a-Phish Workshop**    | Teams design a safe phishing email — then explain what made it convincing. |
