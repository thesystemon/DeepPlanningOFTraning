## üìö Slide / PDF Content ‚Äî In Depth

---

### **Slide 1 ‚Äî ‚ÄúCode is Power ‚Äî and Responsibility‚Äù**

> ‚ÄúEvery line of code can either protect or expose your organization.‚Äù

Developers and engineers have unique power ‚Äî their work defines how securely data is stored, transmitted, and processed. A small mistake like leaving a key in GitHub can expose entire systems.

üí° **Key Threats Developers Face:**

* Exposed secrets (API keys, DB passwords)
* Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, Command Injection)
* Insecure deserialization
* Outdated dependencies (vulnerable libraries)
* Weak authentication logic
* Misconfigured CI/CD pipelines

üß© **Example:**
In 2022, a fintech startup exposed AWS keys in GitHub ‚Äî resulting in complete S3 data leakage within 24 hours.

---

### **Slide 2 ‚Äî Secure Coding Mindset (Shift Left Security)**

Traditional security ‚Üí Tested *after* code is written.
Modern security ‚Üí Built *into* every development step.

| Stage           | Secure Practice                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Design**      | Threat modeling, data classification   |
| **Development** | Input validation, least privilege code |
| **Testing**     | SAST/DAST scanning, secure unit tests  |
| **Deployment**  | Hardening, secret management           |
| **Maintenance** | Patch dependencies, monitor for CVEs   |

üß© Tip: Treat security bugs like functional bugs ‚Äî **track and fix** them with equal priority.

---

### **Slide 3 ‚Äî Common Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)**

| Vulnerability                   | Example                       | Prevention                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Injection**                   | SQL: `' OR 1=1--`             | Use prepared statements        |
| **Broken Auth**                 | Weak login logic              | Implement JWT + bcrypt         |
| **Sensitive Data Exposure**     | Unencrypted DB                | Encrypt at rest and in transit |
| **XXE**                         | XML parser attack             | Disable external entities      |
| **Insecure Deserialization**    | Object injection              | Validate serialized input      |
| **Security Misconfiguration**   | Default creds, open S3 bucket | Harden configurations          |
| **XSS**                         | `<script>alert(1)</script>`   | Sanitize user inputs           |
| **CSRF**                        | Forged web requests           | Use CSRF tokens                |
| **Using Vulnerable Components** | Outdated libraries            | Use dependency scanning        |
| **Insufficient Logging**        | No monitoring                 | Enable audit logging           |

üß© Activity: Show code examples of SQL Injection and secure prepared statement equivalent.

### **Slide 4 ‚Äî Secret Management (API Keys, Passwords, Tokens)**

> ‚ÄúHardcoded credentials = open door for attackers.‚Äù

| Don‚Äôt                          | Do                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Store API keys in code         | Use secret vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) |
| Commit `.env` files to Git     | Add `.env` to `.gitignore`                               |
| Share secrets in Slack/email   | Use password vault or secure channels                    |
| Use same key for all services  | Rotate keys regularly                                    |
| Store private keys unencrypted | Use key management system (KMS)                          |

üß© Example:
`config.js` ‚Üí contains `db_password = "admin123"` ‚Üí if pushed to GitHub, it‚Äôs automatically scanned by bots within minutes.

---

### **Slide 5 ‚Äî Dependency & Package Security**

> ‚ÄúYou inherit every vulnerability your library has.‚Äù

| Area                                  | Best Practice                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dependencies**                      | Use trusted repos only (npm, Maven Central)            |
| **Versioning**                        | Pin exact versions in `package-lock.json` or `pom.xml` |
| **Scanning**                          | Run `npm audit`, `mvn dependency:check`, or `Snyk`     |
| **Update Policy**                     | Regularly patch and test                               |
| **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** | Maintain list of components used for compliance        |

üß© Tip: Never use ‚Äúlatest‚Äù tag in Dockerfiles ‚Äî it can silently pull insecure images.
