### **Slide 1 ‚Äî ‚ÄúCybercriminals Love Finance Teams‚Äù**

> ‚ÄúAttackers follow the money ‚Äî and Finance holds the key to it.‚Äù

Finance departments are the **#1 target** for Business Email Compromise (BEC) and invoice scams globally.

üí∞ **Why?**

* Direct access to money flows
* Access to vendor, salary, and bank accounts
* Regular communication with external vendors and clients

üß© **Example Case:**
In 2024, a manufacturing company lost ‚Çπ1.7 crore after accounts staff paid a fake invoice that looked 99% identical to a real vendor mail ‚Äî only the bank account number was changed.

üìä 83% of financial frauds start with a phishing email (FBI IC3 Report, 2024).

### **Slide 3 ‚Äî How Invoice & Payment Fraud Happens**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Attacker compromises or spoofs a vendor‚Äôs email.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Sends a fake invoice or payment request with changed account details.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Uses ‚Äúurgent‚Äù tone: *‚ÄúPayment pending! Late fees apply!‚Äù*
4Ô∏è‚É£ Finance staff pays to wrong account ‚Üí money gone.

üí£ Once the payment is made, reversal is almost impossible.

üß© **Live Example:**

> Subject: *Urgent Invoice #4789 Due Today*
> ‚ÄúPlease process payment of ‚Çπ4,75,000 to new account number ‚Äî we‚Äôve migrated banks.‚Äù
