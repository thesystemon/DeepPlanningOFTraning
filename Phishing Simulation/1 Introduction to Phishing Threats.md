## 📚 **Slide / PDF Content — In Depth**

---

### **Slide 1 — “The Human Firewall Begins with Awareness”**

> “Phishing is not just an email — it’s a weaponized form of trust.”

* 91% of breaches start with phishing or human error.
* Attackers exploit human curiosity, urgency, and authority — not just technology gaps.
* One click can lead to credential theft, ransomware, or corporate data exposure.

💡 **Trainer Tip:**
Start with a real-world incident — e.g., a company that suffered ransomware after an employee clicked a fake “Invoice” link. Ask: *“What could have prevented this?”*

---

### **Slide 2 — What is Phishing?**

**Definition:**
Phishing is a **social engineering attack** where cybercriminals trick users into revealing confidential data, clicking malicious links, or installing malware — by impersonating a trusted source.

**Key Elements:**

* Deception (fake identity or message)
* Manipulation (psychological triggers)
* Action (click, open, or reply)

💡 **Trainer Tip:**
Explain that phishing ≠ hacking — it’s *tricking*, not *breaking in*. The attacker makes you *invite* them in.

---

### **Slide 3 — The Phishing Lifecycle**

| Stage          | Description                                                 | Example                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 🎣 **Lure**    | The bait — fake message or link designed to trigger emotion | “Your password expires today!”            |
| 🖱️ **Click**  | Victim clicks link or opens attachment                      | Fake login page / malicious PDF           |
| 🔓 **Harvest** | Attacker steals data or installs malware                    | Credentials, payment info, session tokens |

💡 **Trainer Demo:**
Show a sanitized fake email → click → show a dummy login page. Explain how credentials get captured.

---

### **Slide 4 — Common Phishing Types**

| Type                  | Description                                | Realistic Example                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Phishing** | Mass emails to multiple users              | “Your mailbox is full. Click to upgrade.”               |
| **Spear Phishing**    | Targeted at individuals with specific info | “Hi John, here’s the project plan we discussed.”        |
| **Whaling**           | Targeting executives / leadership          | “CEO approval required for payment.”                    |
| **Smishing**          | SMS or chat-based phishing                 | “Your package is delayed — track now.”                  |
| **Vishing**           | Voice call scams                           | “IT Support from Microsoft — please verify your login.” |
| **USB Baiting**       | Dropping infected USB drives               | Labeled “Employee Salary Data – 2025”                   |

💡 **Trainer Tip:**
Discuss which of these are most common in the client’s industry — e.g., finance = whaling; IT = spear phishing.

### **Slide 5 — Red Flags: How to Spot a Phish**

| Category               | Red Flags                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sender Info**        | Unknown domain, misspelled address (`it-support@micros0ft.com`) |
| **Message Tone**       | Urgent, fear-based, or reward-driven                            |
| **Links/Attachments**  | Shortened URLs, mismatched domains, unknown file extensions     |
| **Grammar & Branding** | Typos, outdated logos, inconsistent fonts                       |

💡 **Trainer Demo:**
Project two emails — one genuine, one fake — and ask employees to vote via hand-raise or poll.

---

### **Slide 6 — Psychological Triggers Used in Phishing**

Attackers exploit **human emotions** more than technology:

| Trigger       | Description                 | Example                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Urgency**   | Creates time pressure       | “Your account will be locked in 2 hours.” |
| **Authority** | Uses position or brand name | “From HR Director”                        |
| **Fear**      | Threatens consequences      | “Your salary may be delayed.”             |
| **Curiosity** | Entices to click            | “Confidential company list leaked.”       |
| **Reward**    | Offers fake incentive       | “You’ve won a company bonus!”             |

💡 **Trainer Tip:**
Ask the group: *“Which of these would make you click fastest?”* → Great segue to awareness discussion.

## 🔍 Email Safety Checklist — 18 Quick Checks

(Use this every time you receive an unexpected or unusual email)

1. ☐ **Who is the sender?** — Check the full email address (not just the display name).
2. ☐ **Is the domain correct?** — Look for small typos or swapped characters (micros0ft vs microsoft).
3. ☐ **Does the reply-to match the sender?** — Mismatched reply-to is a red flag.
4. ☐ **Is there an external/unknown tag?** — Many systems add “[External]” — treat those with caution.
5. ☐ **Did you expect this email?** — If it’s unexpected, verify before acting.
6. ☐ **What’s the tone?** — Urgency, threats, or too-good-to-be-true offers are classic tricks.
7. ☐ **Are there grammar or branding errors?** — Typos, odd phrasing, outdated logos signal phishing.
8. ☐ **Hover over links (don’t click)** — Confirm the actual URL matches the claimed site and is not shortened.
9. ☐ **Check attachments before opening** — Unexpected .exe, .zip, .scr, or Office files with macros are dangerous.
10. ☐ **Is it asking for credentials or OTPs?** — Never enter passwords or OTPs into sites linked from email.
11. ☐ **Is it asking to change payment or bank details?** — Require dual approval and verify via a known phone number.
12. ☐ **Are there unusual send times or IP/location hints?** — Strange hours or foreign-sounding timestamps can indicate compromise.
13. ☐ **Does the greeting match your relationship?** — Generic “Dear user” vs personalised salutations can be telling.
14. ☐ **Check for unusual attachments or links to cloud docs** — If a cloud doc is used, ensure it’s from a trusted domain and request access via the app, not an email link.
15. ☐ **Look for unexpected BCC or mass recipients** — Could be part of a broader campaign.
16. ☐ **Verify with another channel** — Call or Teams message the sender using a known number/address (not the ones in the email).
17. ☐ **Inspect message headers if still unsure** — Forward full headers to Security/SOC for analysis.
18. ☐ **If suspicious — don’t click: report it** — Use “Report Phishing” in Outlook/Gmail or forward to [security@company.com](mailto:security@company.com) and then delete.
