### **Slide 1 ‚Äî ‚ÄúHR: The Human Gateway to Cybersecurity‚Äù**

> ‚ÄúAttackers don‚Äôt always hack systems ‚Äî they hack people who have access to them.‚Äù

HR departments handle **the most sensitive data** in any organization:

* Background verification reports, medical or legal records

üß© **Trainer Tip:** Start with a real case:

üìä 82% of HR professionals receive phishing emails disguised as job applications (Proofpoint, 2024).
