# 📘 CHAPTER 3 — SAFE WEB BROWSING & AVOIDING MALICIOUS SITES

**Module Goal:**
Help employees browse safely, recognize dangerous websites, avoid downloads from untrusted sources, and understand how browsers protect them (and how to use those protections correctly).

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, learners should be able to:

* Identify warning signs of malicious or fake websites.
* Understand browser security features (HTTPS, padlock, site permissions, sandboxing).
* Avoid risky downloads, fake software updates, and drive-by malware.
* Practice safe use of browser extensions, plugins, and pop-ups.
* Understand how corporate web filtering and policies protect them.
* Know what to do if a suspicious site or pop-up is encountered.

## 📚 Slide / PDF Content — Deep Section-by-Section Breakdown

### **Slide 1 — Introduction / Hook**

> “You open a website, click a link… and suddenly your screen freezes.
> Was it a bug — or a breach?”

Modern attacks start with **unsafe browsing** — not just phishing emails.
One wrong click can install malware, steal data, or lock systems.

---

### **Slide 2 — Why Safe Browsing Matters**

* Over **70% of malware infections** start from visiting a malicious website or downloading fake software.
* Attackers use **SEO poisoning** (malicious Google results) and **malvertising** (infected ads).
* Even trusted websites can get compromised with injected malicious code.
* Safe browsing = proactive defense at the **human level**.

---

### **Slide 3 — Anatomy of a Malicious Website**

Common signs that a site is unsafe:

1. **No HTTPS / broken padlock.**
2. **Strange domain name:** misspellings (`micorsoft.com`, `paypa1.com`).
3. **Overloaded pop-ups** or redirections.
4. **“Your system is infected!”** fake antivirus or update prompts.
5. **Unusual file downloads** that start automatically.

---

### **Slide 4 — Understanding HTTPS & the Padlock**

* HTTPS = encrypted communication between browser and website.
* But ⚠️ **Padlock ≠ Safe site** — attackers can also use HTTPS.
* Always check **domain name + certificate details**, not just the lock icon.
* Use official bookmarks for sensitive logins (banking, email, etc.).

🧩 *Trainer Demo:*
Open two websites — one legitimate (e.g., `https://microsoft.com`) and one fake (`https://micr0soft-support.com`) — show how both can have padlocks, but domain spelling reveals the fake.

---

### **Slide 5 — Fake Software & Drive-by Downloads**

* “Download Now!” pop-ups often hide malware or adware.
* Drive-by attacks install silently when visiting infected sites.
* **Safe habits:**

  * Download software only from **official websites or app stores.**
  * Disable **automatic downloads** in browser settings.
  * Keep browser & plugins updated via official update channels only.

🧩 *Trainer Demo:*
Show how fake download buttons appear on websites (use sandbox screenshots).

---

### **Slide 6 — Pop-ups, Extensions & Browser Hijacks**

* Extensions can spy, redirect, or steal data.
* Only install extensions from trusted sources (Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons).
* Review extension permissions regularly (“Can read all site data” = risky).
* Avoid clicking **“Allow Notifications”** on random sites — can lead to spam or scam pop-ups.

🧩 *Trainer Tip:*
Show browser settings → “Site permissions” → disable unwanted notifications & extensions.

---

### **Slide 7 — Corporate Controls & Web Filtering**

* Many organizations use **web filters, proxies, and DNS protection** (like Cloudflare Gateway, OpenDNS).
* These block known malicious or adult content sites automatically.
* **Employee responsibility:**

  * Don’t bypass corporate filters (using VPNs or proxies).
  * Report blocked site issues to IT instead of disabling filters.
  * Avoid connecting to corporate apps on **public Wi-Fi** without VPN.

---

### **Slide 8 — Public Wi-Fi & Safe Browsing on the Go**

* Public Wi-Fi = untrusted network. Attackers can sniff unencrypted traffic.
* Always use **VPN** when accessing company data over public Wi-Fi.
* Disable **file sharing** and **auto-connect** features.
* Avoid logging into sensitive accounts in cafés, airports, etc.

🧩 *Trainer Demo:*
Show a short simulation of Wi-Fi “Man-in-the-Middle” attack (video or animation).

---

### **Slide 9 — Sandboxing & Browser Profiles**

* Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) sandbox each tab to limit malware impact.
* **Best practice:**

  * Keep browser updated.
  * Use **separate profiles** for work and personal use.
  * Avoid installing random plugins on your work profile.

---

### **Slide 10 — Reporting Suspicious Websites**

1. If a website looks fake or suspicious:

   * Close the tab immediately.
   * Report to IT/SOC via the official email or ticket.
   * Provide the **URL, screenshot, and timestamp** (no need to explore the site).
2. Use browser’s built-in **“Report unsafe site”** feature (e.g., Chrome: Help → Report Issue).

---

### **Slide 11 — Browser Security Settings Checklist**

✅ Keep browser auto-update ON.
✅ Disable “Allow pop-ups” globally (enable only for known sites).
✅ Clear cookies/cache regularly.
✅ Turn off password saving in browsers (use password managers instead).
✅ Enable Safe Browsing / Enhanced Protection mode.

---

### **Slide 12 — Hands-On Activities**

**Activity A — Spot the Fake Site:**
Trainer shows 3 screenshots; employees identify real vs fake by checking domain, SSL, content.

**Activity B — Browser Settings Workshop:**
Participants open browser settings and enable security options (safe browsing, disable pop-ups).

**Activity C — Extension Check:**
Each participant reviews their browser extensions and removes unknown ones.

---

### **Slide 13 — Real Case Study**

**Incident:** A staff member downloaded “Zoom Update.exe” from a fake site.
**Impact:** Malware installed, led to ransomware entry.
**Lesson:** Always use official download sources and verify URLs.

---

### **Slide 14 — KPI / Metrics to Report**

* % users enabling “Safe Browsing” or “Enhanced Protection.”
* # of reported suspicious sites per month (higher = awareness working).
* # of incidents of browser malware (should decrease).
* # of blocked malicious domains by corporate DNS filter.

---

### **Slide 15 — Trainer Checklist**

* Prepare screenshots of real vs fake websites.
* Sandbox fake site examples for demo.
* Browser security guide (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
* Create quick 10-point “Safe Browsing Checklist” handout (PDF).
* Google Forms quiz (see below).
