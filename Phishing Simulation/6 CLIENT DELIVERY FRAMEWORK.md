## 🧱 **Step-by-Step Framework**

| **Step**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Tools / Format**                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Kickoff & Assessment**        | Begin with an **awareness baseline survey** to measure current employee knowledge. The goal is to understand how well users can identify phishing and their current habits.                                                  | **Google Forms / Microsoft Forms**          |
| **2. Deliver Core Training**       | Conduct a **1-hour live session** (virtual or on-site) or a **self-paced LMS video** module covering fundamentals — phishing types, red flags, and reporting procedures. Distribute a **PDF handout** or slide deck summary. | **PowerPoint + PDF Handout**                |
| **3. Run Phishing Simulation**     | Execute an **internal phishing simulation** using realistic lures that mimic real-world attacks. Track who clicks, who reports, and who ignores. Use **GoPhish or internal simulation platforms.**                           | **GoPhish / Internal Platform**             |
| **4. Educate via Teachable Pages** | When employees click simulation links, redirect them to **custom teachable landing pages** explaining what clues they missed and how to avoid such mistakes next time.                                                       | **Custom Landing Pages**                    |
| **5. Reinforce**                   | Send **weekly micro-tips**, awareness posters, and short reminders via internal communication channels. Keep the content short, visual, and practical.                                                                       | **Canva / Mailchimp / Slack**               |
| **6. Assess & Report**             | Collect simulation data and create a **dashboard** showing improvement in click rates, reporting rates, and engagement. Present results in monthly review meetings.                                                          | **Google Sheets / Power BI**                |
| **7. Certification**               | Recognize employees who complete the program successfully by awarding them a **“Phishing Aware Employee”** badge or certificate.                                                                                             | **Canva / PDF Generator / LMS Certificate** |

## 🧩 **Detailed Explanation of Each Step**

### **Step 1 — Kickoff & Assessment**

* Conduct a short, anonymous survey before training.
* Example questions:

  * “Would you click a link if it came from HR?”
  * “Do you know how to verify a sender’s domain?”
* The goal is to capture a **baseline awareness score** for later comparison.

🔧 *Tools:* Google Forms or Microsoft Forms
📈 *Output:* Baseline Awareness Report

---

### **Step 2 — Deliver Core Training**

* Deliver engaging live or virtual sessions that mix stories, visuals, and examples.
* Include **interactive Q&A** or mini-polls to increase participation.
* Provide **summary PDFs** or quick-reference checklists afterward.

🎥 *Format:* 1-hour session or LMS video
📘 *Material:* PowerPoint deck + PDF guide
🎯 *Outcome:* Employees gain foundational phishing recognition and reporting skills.

---

### **Step 3 — Run Phishing Simulation**

* Schedule a **realistic phishing test** using emails that mirror real cyberattacks.
* Example lures: password reset, HR notice, or package delivery update.
* Analyze click and report behavior to identify high-risk users.

🧰 *Tool:* GoPhish / Internal Platform
📊 *Data Collected:* Click rate, Report rate, Response time
🎯 *Outcome:* Practical measurement of employee resilience.

---

### **Step 4 — Educate via Teachable Pages**

* Anyone who clicks the fake email link lands on a **teachable awareness page**.
* This page explains:

  * The **red flags** they missed (e.g., fake sender, urgency).
  * What to do next time (report, verify, don’t click).
* Keeps the tone **positive and educational**, never punitive.

🌐 *Tool:* Custom Landing Pages
🧠 *Outcome:* Real-time learning from mistakes.

---

### **Step 5 — Reinforce**

* Continuous reinforcement helps habits stick.
* Share **1 micro-tip weekly**, e.g.:

  * “Hover before you click!”
  * “Check sender domains carefully.”
* Display posters near office workstations or post reminders in Slack channels.

🎨 *Tools:* Canva (visuals), Mailchimp or Slack (distribution)
📅 *Frequency:* Weekly / Biweekly
🎯 *Outcome:* Reinforces phishing awareness culture across teams.

---

### **Step 6 — Assess & Report**

* Collect metrics:

  * Before and after click rates
  * Number of reported phishing attempts
  * Participation and quiz completion
* Use tools like Power BI or Google Sheets to **visualize improvement trends**.
* Share results with leadership to demonstrate ROI.

📊 *Tools:* Power BI / Google Sheets
📈 *Outcome:* Quantifiable awareness progress and transparency.

---

### **Step 7 — Certification**

* Employees who complete the full awareness cycle get a **digital certificate** or badge.
* Recognition boosts engagement and encourages others to complete training.
* Can also be integrated into performance goals or compliance requirements.

🏅 *Tools:* Canva, LMS Badge Generator, or PDF Generator
🎯 *Outcome:* Motivation, completion tracking, and a sense of achievement.

---

## 🧠 **Best Practices for Effective Delivery**

* Maintain a **positive, learning-first tone** — never shame mistakes.
* Keep training **short, visual, and scenario-based.**
* Update simulations every quarter to stay relevant to new phishing trends.
* Use **data-driven reporting** to justify improvements and ROI.
* Pair awareness with **technical controls** (email filters, link scanning) for complete protection.

---

## 📈 **Outcome**

✅ Structured delivery of a complete phishing awareness lifecycle.
✅ Continuous reinforcement ensures behavioral retention.
✅ Measurable progress through metrics and dashboards.
✅ Certified, security-aware employees — reducing organizational phishing risk.
