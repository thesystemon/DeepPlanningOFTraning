## 📚 Slide / PDF Content — In Depth

### **Slide 1 — “Frontline Staff: First Defense Against Cyber Threats”**

> “Your support team is the first human firewall — every call, chat, and ticket is a potential attack vector.”

Frontline staff have access to sensitive information: customer PII, billing details, support tickets, troubleshooting logs, and sometimes privileged internal knowledge. Attackers exploit this trust using **social engineering**.

💡 **Common Threats:**

* Caller pretending to be a client requesting sensitive info.
* Phishing links sent in support tickets or chats.
* Malicious attachments in customer emails.
* Internal policy bypass attempts (asking for password resets).
* Fake complaint or urgent requests to manipulate staff.

🧩 **Trainer Tip:** Share a real incident where a support agent almost gave access to an attacker — highlight red flags.

### **Slide 2 — Types of Social Engineering Attacks**

| Type                        | Description                      | Example                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Vishing (Voice)**         | Phone-based phishing             | Fake customer requesting password or OTP     |
| **Smishing (SMS)**          | SMS-based phishing               | Malicious link disguised as billing alert    |
| **Phishing (Email)**        | Email impersonation              | “Support ticket attached — click to resolve” |
| **In-Person Impersonation** | Someone posing as IT or delivery | Requests office or system access             |
| **Chat/Helpdesk Scams**     | Fake clients in chat platforms   | Asking for internal data or credentials      |

🧩 **Activity:** Play 2–3 short audio clips of vishing attempts — ask staff to identify suspicious cues.

### **Slide 3 — Customer Data Handling**

| Data Type                         | Handling Guidelines                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PII** (Name, DOB, email, phone) | Confirm identity, avoid sharing over insecure channels           |
| **Financial Data**                | Never provide full credit card numbers; follow payment protocols |
| **Support Logs**                  | Limit access; mask sensitive data when sharing internally        |
| **Internal Notes**                | Only share with team members on a need-to-know basis             |

💡 **Tip:** Always verify request origin before sharing info, even if it seems urgent.

### **Slide 4 — Verification & Authentication**

> “Trust, but verify — always.”

✅ **Best Practices:**

1. Ask security questions without revealing answers.
2. Confirm via official email or phone number.
3. Never share credentials, passwords, or OTPs over phone or chat.
