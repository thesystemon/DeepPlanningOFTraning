## 📚 Slide / PDF Content — In Depth

---

### **Slide 1 — What Is a “Micro-Learning Topic Library”?**

“Think of it as your company’s cyber gym — bite-sized exercises to keep awareness muscles strong.”

A **Micro-Learning Library** is a curated collection of **short, focused lessons** (2–5 mins each) designed to:

* Keep awareness fresh throughout the year.
* Reinforce core behaviors (reporting, password hygiene, phishing response).
* Introduce **new threat trends** without overwhelming users.

🧩 **Trainer Tip:** Emphasize that micro-learning = *habit formation*, not just information sharing.
