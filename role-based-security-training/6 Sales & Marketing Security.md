## 📚 Slide / PDF Content — In Depth

---

### **Slide 1 — “You Sell Trust Before You Sell Products”**

> “Every deal, every lead, every click represents customer trust. Lose it once — and it’s gone forever.”

Sales & marketing teams handle sensitive client information: emails, phone numbers, contracts, proposals, and campaign data. Attackers often impersonate customers or vendors to trick employees into sending money or credentials.

💡 **Common Threats:**

* Fake client emails or invoices (phishing)
* Compromised CRM logins
* Exposed spreadsheets with customer data
* Oversharing on social media (event photos, partner info)
* Fake job or partnership proposals
* Malicious ads or tracking links

🧩 **Trainer Tip:** Show a real “fake client email” that looks genuine — highlight subtle warning signs.

### **Slide 2 — Customer & Lead Data Protection**

| Data Type                     | Example               | Secure Handling Practice               |

🧠 **Tactics Attackers Use:**

* Spoofed client emails (“@micros0ft.com”)
* Malicious links in RFPs or proposals
* Fake event invites (PDFs with malware)
* CEO / CFO impersonation requesting urgent payment or quote

💡 **Defense:**

* Always verify sender domain
* Hover before clicking links

* Report suspicious emails immediately

🧩 **Trainer Activity:** Show two identical emails — one real, one fake — and ask the team to spot the difference.

### **Slide 5 — Social Media & Brand Security**

> “One careless post can reveal company strategy.”

| Platform                 | Secure Practice                                    |
