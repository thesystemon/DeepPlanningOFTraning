## 📚 **Slide / PDF Content — In Depth**

---

### **Slide 1 — “The Human Firewall Begins with Awareness”**

> “Phishing is not just an email — it’s a weaponized form of trust.”

* 91% of breaches start with phishing or human error.
* Attackers exploit human curiosity, urgency, and authority — not just technology gaps.
* One click can lead to credential theft, ransomware, or corporate data exposure.

💡 **Trainer Tip:**
Start with a real-world incident — e.g., a company that suffered ransomware after an employee clicked a fake “Invoice” link. Ask: *“What could have prevented this?”*

---

### **Slide 2 — What is Phishing?**

**Definition:**
Phishing is a **social engineering attack** where cybercriminals trick users into revealing confidential data, clicking malicious links, or installing malware — by impersonating a trusted source.

**Key Elements:**

* Deception (fake identity or message)
* Manipulation (psychological triggers)
* Action (click, open, or reply)

💡 **Trainer Tip:**
Explain that phishing ≠ hacking — it’s *tricking*, not *breaking in*. The attacker makes you *invite* them in.

---

### **Slide 3 — The Phishing Lifecycle**

| Stage          | Description                                                 | Example                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 🎣 **Lure**    | The bait — fake message or link designed to trigger emotion | “Your password expires today!”            |
| 🖱️ **Click**  | Victim clicks link or opens attachment                      | Fake login page / malicious PDF           |
| 🔓 **Harvest** | Attacker steals data or installs malware                    | Credentials, payment info, session tokens |

💡 **Trainer Demo:**
Show a sanitized fake email → click → show a dummy login page. Explain how credentials get captured.

### **Slide 4 — Common Phishing Types**

| Type                  | Description                                | Realistic Example                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Phishing** | Mass emails to multiple users              | “Your mailbox is full. Click to upgrade.”               |
| **Spear Phishing**    | Targeted at individuals with specific info | “Hi John, here’s the project plan we discussed.”        |
| **Whaling**           | Targeting executives / leadership          | “CEO approval required for payment.”                    |
| **Smishing**          | SMS or chat-based phishing                 | “Your package is delayed — track now.”                  |
| **Vishing**           | Voice call scams                           | “IT Support from Microsoft — please verify your login.” |
| **USB Baiting**       | Dropping infected USB drives               | Labeled “Employee Salary Data – 2025”                   |

💡 **Trainer Tip:**
Discuss which of these are most common in the client’s industry — e.g., finance = whaling; IT = spear phishing.

### **Slide 6 — Psychological Triggers Used in Phishing**

Attackers exploit **human emotions** more than technology:

| Trigger       | Description                 | Example                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Urgency**   | Creates time pressure       | “Your account will be locked in 2 hours.” |
| **Authority** | Uses position or brand name | “From HR Director”                        |
| **Fear**      | Threatens consequences      | “Your salary may be delayed.”             |
| **Curiosity** | Entices to click            | “Confidential company list leaked.”       |
| **Reward**    | Offers fake incentive       | “You’ve won a company bonus!”             |

💡 **Trainer Tip:**
Ask the group: *“Which of these would make you click fastest?”* → Great segue to awareness discussion.
