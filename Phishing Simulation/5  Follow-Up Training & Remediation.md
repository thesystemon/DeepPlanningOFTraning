## 🧩 Slide 1 — “Falling Once Is Learning, Falling Twice Is a Pattern”

> “Awareness is not built in a day — it’s reinforced through repetition and reflection.”

Most employees don’t fail phishing simulations because of carelessness — they fail due to **momentary lapses or emotional manipulation.**
That’s why **remediation** isn’t punishment — it’s protection through learning.

📊 **Stat:** According to KnowBe4’s 2025 report, employees who receive personalized remediation training show **65% fewer repeat phishing clicks** than those who don’t.

💬 **Trainer Tip:**
Reframe phishing simulations as **coaching opportunities, not tests.**
Encourage open discussion about mistakes — not blame.

## 🧩 Slide 2 — 5 Phishing Samples: Identify Red Flags & Reasoning

Let’s train the **analytical eye** through real-world examples.
Each sample is followed by a breakdown of **red flags** and **the reasoning behind detection.**

---

### 🧪 **Sample 1: HR Bonus Notification**

---

**Subject:** 🎉 “Annual Bonus Announcement – Confirm Your Details Today!”
**Sender:** [hr@compaany-bonus.com](mailto:hr@compaany-bonus.com)
**Body:**

> Dear Employee,
>
> Congratulations! You are eligible for a year-end bonus.
> Please verify your employment details to receive your payout:
> [Confirm Bonus Details Here](http://bonus-companysecure.com/login)
>
> Kind regards,
> HR Department
> Company Inc.

**📍Red Flags:**

1. **Spoofed domain:** `hr@compaany-bonus.com` ≠ official domain.
2. **Urgent tone:** “Confirm today!” pressures immediate action.
3. **Suspicious link:** Hover shows `bonus-companysecure.com` (not company domain).
4. **Too good to be true:** Emotional trigger using reward/greed.
5. **Generic greeting:** “Dear Employee” — not personalized.

**💡 Reasoning:**
This email exploits *reward psychology* and *trust in HR*. The attacker tempts users with bonuses to harvest credentials through a fake login page.

---

### 🧪 **Sample 2: IT Password Expiration Alert**

---

**Subject:** ⚠️ “Password Expiring in 24 Hours — Action Required”
**Sender:** IT Support [support@it-dept-secure.com](mailto:support@it-dept-secure.com)
**Body:**

> Dear User,
> Your company account password will expire in 24 hours.
> Please reset your password immediately to avoid lockout.
> [Reset Password Now](http://it-dept-reset.com)
>
> IT Security Team

**📍Red Flags:**

1. **Fake urgency:** 24-hour deadline = manipulation of fear.
2. **Unverified domain:** “it-dept-secure.com” not company-owned.
3. **Link mismatch:** Hover reveals third-party domain.
4. **Generic greeting:** No personalization.
5. **Language mismatch:** Company IT would use official password portal.

**💡 Reasoning:**
Uses **authority and fear** to trick users into credential submission. IT wouldn’t email password reset links directly — always through internal portals or SSO notifications.

---

### 🧪 **Sample 3: CEO Payment Request**

---

**Subject:** “URGENT: Immediate Wire Transfer Needed”
**Sender:** [ceo@company-exec.net](mailto:ceo@company-exec.net)
**Body:**

> Hi,
> I’m in a meeting and can’t talk right now. Please transfer $10,000 to vendor ASAP.
> I’ll explain later.
>
> Bank Details Attached.

**📍Red Flags:**

1. **Impersonation of CEO:** Domain variation “company-exec.net”.
2. **Urgency + secrecy:** “Can’t talk now” and “ASAP” blocks verification.
3. **Financial request via email:** Unusual for company process.
4. **Attachment:** May contain malicious macro or data.
5. **No signature / phone verification.**

**💡 Reasoning:**
Classic **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** attack using *authority* and *pressure*. Employees should always verify such requests via direct phone or chat confirmation.

---

### 🧪 **Sample 4: Courier Delivery Failure**

---

**Subject:** 📦 “Your Package Could Not Be Delivered – Confirm Address”
**Sender:** [delivery@dhl-support.net](mailto:delivery@dhl-support.net)
**Body:**

> Hello,
> We attempted to deliver your parcel but failed due to incorrect address.
> Please confirm your shipping details to reschedule delivery.
> [Confirm Address](http://dhl-verifydelivery.net)
>
> DHL Express Support

**📍Red Flags:**

1. **Spoofed brand:** Domain doesn’t match DHL official (`dhl.com`).
2. **Unexpected message:** No prior shipment expected.
3. **Suspicious URL:** Hover shows unrelated domain.
4. **Sense of urgency:** “Confirm to reschedule quickly.”
5. **Brand misuse:** Logo or name used without corporate tone.

**💡 Reasoning:**
This phish relies on **curiosity and routine behavior.** Many users think it’s harmless to check — but the link likely leads to a fake login or malware drop site.

---

### 🧪 **Sample 5: Microsoft 365 Login Verification**

---

**Subject:** 🔒 “Unusual Sign-In Attempt Detected”
**Sender:** Microsoft Security [alert@microsoft365-securelogin.com](mailto:alert@microsoft365-securelogin.com)
**Body:**

> Someone tried to sign in from an unrecognized device.
> If this was you, ignore this message.
> If not, please verify and secure your account:
> [Secure My Account](http://microsoft365-loginverify.com)
>
> Thank you,
> Microsoft Account Protection

**📍Red Flags:**

1. **Domain mismatch:** Not from `microsoft.com` but `microsoft365-securelogin.com`.
2. **Fear-based tone:** “Unrecognized device” = immediate fear trigger.
3. **Link mismatch:** Fake URL pretending to be Microsoft portal.
4. **Generic formatting:** Missing official branding consistency.
5. **No digital signature:** Genuine Microsoft alerts come with “Microsoft account” verification link and DKIM/SPF alignment.

**💡 Reasoning:**
Uses **fear and legitimacy mimicry.** Attackers exploit the trust users place in familiar brands like Microsoft to steal credentials.

---

## 📈 Outcome of This Exercise

✅ Employees learn to **pause and critically assess** email details before interacting.
✅ Builds **pattern recognition** for common attacker tactics (urgency, curiosity, reward).

## 🧩 Slide 4 — Teachable Landing Pages

When a user clicks a phishing simulation link, redirect them to a **“Teachable Moment Page.”**

### 🧭 Landing Page Should Include:

✅ Immediate feedback: “This was a phishing simulation.”
✅ Highlight 3–5 clues that gave it away.
✅ Short 1–2 minute video on safe email habits.
✅ One-sentence rule: “Pause. Think. Verify before you click.”
✅ Option to retry spotting red flags in another sample.

💬 **Trainer Example:**
Use bright visuals and simple tone:

> “You’re not alone — 1 in 3 employees clicked this simulation. Let’s learn how to stop the next one together.”

This **turns a mistake into a micro-lesson**, not embarrassment.

---

## 🧩 Slide 5 — Personalized Remediation & Coaching

### 🎯 For High-Risk Users:

* Provide **one-on-one or small-group coaching sessions.**
* Review their simulation behavior (where they clicked, why).
* Encourage **self-reflection:** “What made you trust that email?”
* Offer **interactive micro-learning** with gamified Q&A (“Find the red flag” challenge).
* Schedule **refresher e-learning module:** *“Phishing in 5 Minutes.”*

### 💬 Delivery Methods:

| Channel                          | Description                                    |
